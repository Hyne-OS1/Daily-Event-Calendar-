# Casey's Work Day Planner

https://hyne-os1.github.io/Daily-Event-Calendar-/

## Description

* My motivation for this project was to create an easy and straightforward workday planner using HTML, CSS and javascript (more specifically jquery).

* The building of this project was to create a site that gave the user the ability to input their own personal tasks into a calender that relates to a full work day (hrs 9AM-5PM).

* Taking on this project definitely had its challenging aspects of jquery and I did run into a few bumps along the way. This project not only acts as a good memory refresher but also a good point of reference on how to call certain functions using jquery and its accompanying languages. 

## Usage

* Using this site is very easy an straightforward simply add your tasks to each corresponding time/text box ensuring to press the save button upon finishing to ensure the tasks saves to your local storage and does not disappear upon refreshing your page.
